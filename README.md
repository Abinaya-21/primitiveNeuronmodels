# Primitive neuron model - Supervised Classification Type

Description:
        Breast cancer dataset is loaded from the sklearn package . Primitive Neuron models like McCulloch Pitts Neuron(MP Neuron) and Perceptron are used to classify data. It is a biary classification Model . The model will predict whether a test sample falls under Benign or Malignant type .
       
Tools Required:
        These models are built in google collabaratory platform .So,there is no installation steps required for the collab notebooks .
        Python 3 is used for building the models . Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn etc packages are used for building these models
